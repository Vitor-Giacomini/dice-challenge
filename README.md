(1) Build the following figure in your application, taking the following care:

A) Each point must be stored as a point object

B) Each face of the die must be treated as a class that has as attributes:

i. A list of points

ii. A polygon that forms the sides of the face.

(2) About the figure (in fact, about the objects in the figure):

A) Move the figure to the left – ½ measurement from the side of a face

B) Move the figure down – ½ measurement from the side of a face

C) Return the figure to the original position, doing the inverse of the
movements of steps a and b

D) Enlarge the figure by 20%, around the center point of the face that
represents 1 of the die.

E) Reduce the figure by 50%, around the center point of the face that
represents the 5 on the die.

F) Rotate the figure 45º counterclockwise, around the point
center of the face that represents the 1 of the die.

G) Keeping face 1 in its position, move the other faces away from it ½ measure
on the side of a face.

NOTE: The transformations in exercise 2 must be implemented in such a way that the
user switches from one state to another by pressing a certain key
